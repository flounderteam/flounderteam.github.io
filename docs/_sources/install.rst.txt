Installation
==================

The entire Zipline-based research platform can be installed from basic conda with the following steps::
  
    $ conda create --name flounder python=3.6
    $ conda activate flounder
    $ conda install numpy
    $ conda install cython
    $ pip install fsharadar

The *fsharadar* installation also includes dependencies on the primary platform

framewotk and `Alphalens <https://github.com/quantopian/alphalens>`_
post-processing library.
